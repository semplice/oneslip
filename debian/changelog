oneslip (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Eugenio Paolantonio (g7) ]
  * Ensure we open stock browser windows only if the user clicked a link.
  * Do not segfault on exits.
  * Catch KeyboardInterrupts.
  * Set nicer titles when loading.
  * Spawn stock browser on new windows, too.
  * Ensure we update the window title when the page's one changes
  * It's now possible to specify initial window title at invocation.
  * Speed up opening by not testing the internet connection.
    If connection is absent, load-failed will be fired and we will warn the user accordingly.
  * Some bugfixes in add-app
  * Had some fun with favicons and webkit's favicondatabase.
  * Refactored the getFavicon method in addapp: now we directly use WebKit.
    The code is a bit ugly because we can't currently get the favicon from the database, but it gets the job done.
  * Open oneslip window at center.

  [ Giuseppe 'GsC_RuL3Z' Corti ]
